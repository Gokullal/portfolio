        My interest in technology sparked when I was 15 and created my first
        website, a simple "Hello World!" display. Since then, I delved into web
        design and computers, teaching myself HTML, CSS, and PHP while doing my
        bachelor's degree. 
      </br> My first step towards my career was when I helped develop my
        college's website. After graduation, I became a WordPress developer at
        Intertoons Internet Services. While starting with WordPress, my
        curiosity led me to volunteer for various projects, like handling
        servers. I quickly took on more responsibilities, independently managing
        new servers, ensuring regular backups, handling migrations, and updating
        dotnet web applications to the virtual machines regularly. Over time, I oversaw a significant
        infrastructure, managing over 15 servers and all WordPress websites,
        earning Employee of the Month twice. 
        </br>I then pursued an MSC in Cloud
        Computing in the UK, graduating with distinction. Throughout my studies,
        I undertook assignments showcasing my ability to adapt to new
        technologies and deepened my knowledge of Azure. Now, with both
        knowledge and practical experience, I'm eager to transition into a Cloud
        Engineer role, contributing to the dynamic field of cloud computing
